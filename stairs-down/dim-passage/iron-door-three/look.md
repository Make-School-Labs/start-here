The door to this room was locked from the outside. You unlock it to open the door. 

The room has a small palette of straw, a wooden stool, and a bucket. A goblin lies on the palette. It sits up with a start and rubs it's eyes when you open the door, says thanks bro and scurries past you and down the passage.
